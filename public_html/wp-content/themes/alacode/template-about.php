					<p class="team-note"> Welcome to <span class="pink-text-highlight">A La Code!</span> We're Ana Goodwin and Jillian Flook. We're two web developers in Austin, Texas. We met at the Coding Bootcamp at The University of Texas, and we bonded over our mutual love of all things design, good coffee, terrible puns, and all things cactus-themed. A La Code is our joint project where we chronicle our lives and our journey as frontend developers. We hope you enjoy following along as we explore Austin! The reader is now informed that the rest of this note will consist of only quotes from Arrested Development (a cornerstone of our friendship), you have been warned.  </p>

					You might wanna lean away from that fire since you're soaked in alcohol. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.)

					They frame my junk. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear.
					</p>

					Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. I figured out a way to make money while I'm working!</p>

				<h3 class="pink-text-highlight">Ana Goodwin</h3>
				<p class="about-text text-left">I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive websites. I love incorporating my background in design into my work as a front-end developer. When I'm not diving into learning new programming skills, you can find me running my Etsy shop, illustrating, or making terrible puns (actually it's probably a combination of the 3).

				<p class="about-text text-left">I am a Texas native and after exploring the Lone Star State, I happily settled in Austin. My focus is in mobile responsiveness and UX of front-end applications. There are many things that I love about this field, one of which being the endless learning potential. Outside of the web-dev realm, you can find me at one of Austin's many beautiful parks.
