		<p>Welcome to A La Code! We're Ana Goodwin and Jillian Flook. We're two web developers in Austin, Texas. We met at the Coding Bootcamp at The University of Texas, and we bonded over our mutual love of all things design, good coffee, terrible puns, and all things cactus-themed. A La Code is our joint project where we chronicle our lives and our journey as frontend developers. We hope you enjoy following along as we explore Austin! </p>
